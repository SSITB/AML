    "# Estimating Financial Risk through Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "Risk analysis is part of every decision we make when faced with uncertainty, ambiguity, and variability. Indeed, even though we have unprecedented access to information, we can't accurately predict the future. In finance, there is a fair amount of uncertainty and risk involved with estimating the future value of financial products, due to the wide variety of potential outcomes. Monte Carlo simulation (also known as the Monte Carlo Method) allows inspecting many possible outcomes of the decision making process, and can be used to assess the impact of risk: this, in turns, allows for better decision making under uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "The main objectives we set for this Notebook are as follows:\n",
    "1. Develop fudamental knowledge about Risk analysis\n",
    "2. Understand Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS)\n",
    "3. Apply Monte Carlo Simulation for predicting risk\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "1. First, in section 1, we introduce the basics of MCS\n",
    "2. In section 2, we work on a simple example to where we apply the MCS method\n",
    "3. In section 3, we briefly summarize the main characteristics of the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) technique\n",
    "4. In section 4, we overview the common distributions which are often used in MCS\n",
    "5. In section 5, we work on a real use case, that focuses on estimating financial risk. We will use techniques such as featurizing (that is, generating additional features to improve model accuracy), linear regression, kernel density estimation, sampling distributions and so on ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reference\n",
    "This Notebook is inspired by Chapter 9 of the book [Advanced Analytics with Spark](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035091.do) by Josh Wills, Sandy Ryza, Sean Owen, and Uri Laserson. It is strongly suggested to read this Chapter to get a general idea of the topic of this Notebook.\n",

    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS)\n",
    "Monte Carlo simulation is a computerized mathematical technique that can be applied such that it is possible to account for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making. This technique is used in many different fields, such as R&D, risk management, portfolio management, pricing derivatives, strategic planning, project planning, cost modeling and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, MCS is a technique that \"converts\" uncertainty on input variables of a model into **probability distributions**. By combining the distributions and randomly selecting values from them, it recalculates the simulated model many times, to determine the probability of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, this technique was first used by scientists working on the atomic bomb: it was named after Monte Carlo, the Monaco resort town renowned for its casinos.  Since its introduction in World War II, Monte Carlo simulation has been used to model a variety of physical and conceptual systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. How does it work?\n",
    "Monte Carlo simulation performs risk analysis by building models of possible results by *substituting a range of possible input values, that constitute uncertainty, into a statistical distribution*. It then computes possible outcomes repeatedly, each time using a different set of random values from the probability functions that \"model\" the input. Depending upon the number of random input variables and their distribution, a Monte Carlo simulation could involve thousands or tens of thousands of \"rounds\" before it is complete. When complete, *Monte Carlo simulation produces distributions of possible outcome values*.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using probability distributions instead of actual input samples, it is possible to model more accurately uncertainty: different choices of distributions will yield different outputs."

    "\n",
    "- Sales volume in units\n",

    "Net profit will be calculated as $Net Profit = Sales Volume* (Selling Price - Unit cost) - Fixed costs$.  Fixed costs (accounting for various overheads, advertising budget, etc.) are known to be \\$ 120,000, which we assume to be deterministic. All other factors, instead, involve some uncertainty: *sales volume* (in units) can cover quite a large range, the *selling price* per unit will depend on competitor actions, which are hard to predict, and *unit costs* will also vary depending on vendor prices and production experience, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to build a risk analysis model, we must first identify the uncertain variables -- which are essentially random variables.  While there's some uncertainty in almost all variables in a business model, we want to focus on variables where the range of values is significant."

    "As discussed before, the selling price and selling volume both depend on the state of the market scenario (slow/normal/hot). So, the net profit is the result of two random variables: `market scenario` (which in turn determines `sales volumes` and `selling price`) and `unit cost`.\n",

Then, we can compute directly the values for selling price and selling volumes based on the outcome of the random variable `market scenario`, as shown in Section 2.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "From these a-priori distributions, in each run (or trial) of our Monte Carlo simulation, we can generate the sample value for each random variable and use it to calculate the Net Profit. The more simulation runs, the more accurate our results will be. For example, if we run the simulation 100,000 times, the average net profit will amount to roughly \\$92,600. Every time we run the simulation, a different prediction will be output: the average of such predictions will consistently be less than \\$117,500, which we predicted using averages only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that in this simple example, we generate values for the `market scenario` and `unit cost` independently: we consider them to be **independent random variables**. This means that the eventual (and realistic!) correlation between the `market scenario` and `unit cost` variables is ignored. Later, we will learn how to be more precise and account for dependency between random variables.\n"

    "- A MCS allows several inputs to be used at the same time to compute the probability distribution of one or more outputs\n",
    "- Different types of probability distributions can be assigned to the inputs of the model, depending on any *a-priori* information that is available. When the distribution is completely unknown, a common technique is to use a distribution computed by finding the best fit to the data you have\n",
    "- The MCS method is also called a **stochastic method** because it uses random variables. Note also that the general assumption is for input random variables to be independent from eachother. When this is not the case, there are techniques to account for correlation between random variables.\n",
    "- A MCS generates the output as a range instead of a fixed value and shows how likely the output value is to occur in that range. In other words, the model outputs a probability distribution."

    "In what follows, we summarize the most common probability distributions that are used as *a-priori* distributions for input random variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Normal/Gaussian Distribution*: this is a continuous distribution applied in situations where the mean and the standard deviation of a given input variable are given, and the mean represents the most probable value of the variable. In other words, values \"near\" the mean are most likely to occur.  This is symmetric distribution, and it is not bounded in its co-domain. It is very often used to  describe natural phenomena, such as people’s heights, inflation rates, energy prices, and so on and so forth. An illustration of a normal distribution is given below:\n",
    "![normal_distribution](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Normal_Distribution_PDF.svg/320px-Normal_Distribution_PDF.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Lognormal Distribution* : this is a distribution which is appropriate for variables taking values in the range $[0, \\infty]$. Values are positively skewed, not symmetric like a normal distribution.  Examples of variables described by a lognormal distributions include, for example, real estate property values, stock prices, and oil reserves. An illustration of a lognormal distribution is given below:\n",
    "![log_normal_distribution](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/PDF-log_normal_distributions.svg/320px-PDF-log_normal_distributions.svg.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Triangular Distribution* : this is a continuous distribution with fixed minimum and maximum values. It is bounded by the minimum and maximum values and can be either symmetrical (the most probable value = mean = median) or asymmetrical. Values around the most likely value (e.g. the mean) are more likely to occur.  Variables that could be described by a triangular distribution include, for example, past sales history per unit of time and inventory levels. An illustration of a triangular distribution is given below:\n",
    "![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Triangular_distribution_PMF.png/320px-Triangular_distribution_PMF.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Uniform Distribution* : this is a continuous distribution bounded by known minimum and maximum values. In contrast to the triangular distribution, the likelihood of occurrence of the values between the minimum and maximum is the same. In other words, all values have an equal chance of occurring, and the distribution is simply characterized by the minimum and maximum values. Examples of variables that can be described by a uniform distribution include manufacturing costs or future sales revenues for a new product. An illustration of the uniform distribution is given below:\n",
    "![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Uniform_Distribution_PDF_SVG.svg/320px-Uniform_Distribution_PDF_SVG.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Exponential Distribution* : this is a continuous distribution used to model the time that pass between independent occurrences, provided that the rate of occurrences is known. An example of the exponential distribution is given below:\n",
    "![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Exponential_pdf.svg/320px-Exponential_pdf.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Discrete Distribution* : for this kind of distribution, the \"user\" defines specific values that may occur and the likelihood of each of them.  An example might be the results of a lawsuit: 20% chance of positive verdict, 30% change of negative verdict, 40% chance of settlement, and 10% chance of mistrial.\n"

    "We hope that by now you have a good understanding about Monte Carlo simulation. Next, we apply this method to a real use case: *financial risk estimation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you are an investor on the stock market. You plan to buy some stocks and you want to estimate the maximum loss you could incur after two weeks of investing. This is the quantity that the financial statistic \"Value at Risk\" (VaR) seeks to measure. [VaR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk) is defined as a measure of investment risk that can be used as a reasonable estimate of the maximum probable loss for a value of an investment portfolio, over a particular time period. A VaR statistic depends on three parameters: a portfolio, a time period, and a confidence level. A VaR of 1 million dollars with a 95% confidence level over two weeks, indicates the belief that the portfolio stands only a 5% chance of losing more than 1 million dollars over two weeks. VaR has seen widespread use across financial services organizations. This statistic plays a vital role in determining how much cash investors must hold to meet the credit ratings that they seek. In addition, it is also used to understand the risk characteristics of large portfolios: it is a good idea to compute the VaR before executing trades, such that it can help take informed decisions about investments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is calculating VaR of two weeks interval with 95% confidence level and the associated [VaR confidence interval](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041615/whats-difference-between-confidence-level-and-confidence-interval-value-risk-var.asp).\n",

    "- **Portfolio**: A collection of instruments owned by a financial institution. \n",
    "- **Return**: The change in an instrument or portfolio’s value over a time period. \n",
    "- **Loss**: A negative return. \n",
    "- **Index**: An imaginary portfolio of instruments. For example, the NASDAQ Composite index includes about 3,000 stocks and similar instruments for major US and international companies. \n",
    "- **Market factor**: A value that can be used as an indicator of macro aspects of the financial climate at a particular time. For example, the value of an index, the Gross Domestic Product of the United States, or the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro. We will often refer to market factors as just factors.\n",

However, it's very hard to observe the amount of failures suggested by the confidence level exactly. Therefore, people try to study whether the number of failures is reasonable or not, or will the model be accepted or rejected.\n",

Compared to `3.84`, the critical value of Chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom at probability 5%, the test statistic is larger. So, the model is rejected. The critical values of Chi-squared can be found by following [this link](https://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/tbl-chi.html).\n",
    "However, in this Notebook, it's not a good idea to find the corresponding critical value by looking in a \"messy\" table, especially when we need to change the confidence level. Insteads, from `p-value`, we will calculate the probability of the test statistic in Chi-square thanks to some functions in package `scipy`. If the calculated probability is smaller than the quantile of loss (e.g, 0.05), the model is rejected and vice versa.\n"

    "In this lecture, we studied the Monte Carlo Simulation method and its application to estimate financial risk. To apply it, first, we needed to define the relationship between market factors and the instruments' returns. In such step, you must define the model which maps the market factors' values to the instruments' values: in our use case, we used a linear regression function for building our model. Next, we also had to find the parameters of our model, which are the weights of the factors we considered. Then, we had to study the distribution of each market factor. A good way to do that is using Kernel density estimation to smooth the distribution and plot it. Depending on the shape of each figure, we had to guess the best fit distribution for each factor: in our use case, we used a very simple approach, and decided that our smoothed distributions all looked normal distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the idea of Monte Carlo simulation was to generate many possible values for each factors and calculate the corresponding outcomes by a well defined model in each trial. After many trials, we were able to calculate VaR from the sequences of outcome's values. When the number of trials is large enough, the VaR converges to reasonable values, that we could validate using well-known statistica"
